Hello and Welcome !
Here you will find my files and code for the Disaster Response Pipeline Project
This project combines multiple activities
  - ETL activities
  - ML activities (including NLP activities)
  - Deployment
    
Background:
  This project is based on a project by FigureEight datasets that were collected for a disaster response project.
  This implementation merges, cleans and then creates a SQL database that will be used by a Machine Learning model to categorize the data.
  Following this a web application is used to solicit disaster messages and then suggests where to direct the aid. 
  
 Workspace (folder) structure:
  /app : containes the files for the implementation of the web application
  /data : containes the messages and categories (CSV) files and will contain the newly created SQL database file
  /models : containes the classifier code
